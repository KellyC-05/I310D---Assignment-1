These data are collected around the tea shops by Kelly Chu, which is approved by the owner.

This data is collected with the purpose of finding the customer's prefrences on buying the milk tea, with the detail selection of the drink base, type of toppings added, and the sweetness of the drink. Also this data include the number of cups that participants drinked milk tea in January 2022.

The potential issues are participants' milk tea prefreces may change in different stores and there's no exact evidence to proof the number of cups of milk tea they drink in Janurary 2022 are accurate.
